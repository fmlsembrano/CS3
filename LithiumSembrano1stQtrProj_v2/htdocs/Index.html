		<p>The term "hard" is too simplistically used to characterize people's stories. We all have a tale to
		share that we won't tell just anyone. Life is tough in many ways. Thus, mental health is introduced. Our
		mental health includes all aspects of our physical, psychological, emotional, and social well-being (What
		Is Mental Health? | MentalHealth.gov, n.d.). It helps us cope with stress, interpersonal harmony, and
		make healthy decisions - but there are also some drawbacks. Issues that add a little complexity to daily
		life. Introducing mental health problems!</p>
